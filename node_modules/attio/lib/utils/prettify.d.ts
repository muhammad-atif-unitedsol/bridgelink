/**
 * Makes a type easier to read by evaluating out any indirections inside it.
 * Instead of showing **in the tooltip** how the type is constructed
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * Partial<{x: string, y: string}>
 * ```
 *
 * Will be prettified to:
 *
 * ```ts
 * {
 *   x?: string,
 *   y?: string
 * }
 * ```
